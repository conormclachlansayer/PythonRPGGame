# PythonRPGGame

Text-based RPG style game - at the moment you have three characters who have to fight a boss called Magnus, and 2 side-kicks called Impus and Impis. Use melee, magic or items to defeat them all and win!

Although not identical in code, largely followed this tutorial on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/python-complete/. Would highly recommend as an introduction to Object-orientated programming in Python!
